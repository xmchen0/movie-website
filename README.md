For this assignment, we wrote code to store a list of our favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. We then used our code to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse movies and watch the trailer. This list contains my favourite movies of all time. 

# Key takeouts:
+ Learn to import the webbrowser module to use the web-based documents;
+ Write functions that generate the appropriate output (usually with a return statement) from the appropriate input (function parameters);
+ Define variable names that reflect the purpose of the value stored in it and is kept throughout the program; and
+ Define classes appropriately and demonstrate coding techniques like branching and loops appropriately (i.e., for loop in a list and for testing if something is in a list).
